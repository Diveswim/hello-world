# hello-world
Novice building Arduino Uno CNC
I am a psychologist nearing the end of my porfessional career and toying with some new hobbies.
I acquired a ZenToolworks 12x12 CNC kit, partially assembled and am trying to get it running.
Instead of using CNC software--free or purchased--and a compatible controller board, I want to get
it going directly off the arduino I already have. It's not that I'm cheap. It's more that I want to 
understand this process more fully than I would if I started on an easier path. 
I am not a programmer and I do not know CNC yet. I am a very good fine woodworker and have been 
doing alot of guitar repair as well, both acoustic and electric. I repair nearly anything, including 
cell phones and computers.
I know this is a heavy lift.
Right now, I am learning Fusion 360 and also have GRBL loaded to the arduino. The kit is built and
ready to wire up. I have a map of how GRBL uses the pinouts on the microprocessor. I need a trial 
program to see if I can get movement on the 3 axes, and finding that is where I am at present
